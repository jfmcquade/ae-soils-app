      "audio_transcript": "Ladybugs can be attracted to your farm by planting flowers such as dill, coriander (dania), fennel, and marigolds. They also like areas with plenty of aphids and other small insects for them to feed on.\n\nLadybugs are beneficial to have on your farm because they consume large amounts of pests such as aphids, mites, and whiteflies. In their larval stage,they can consume up to 400 to 500 aphids during development stage, which typically lasts for a few weeks. Adult ladybugs typically consume around 50 to 60 aphids per day.",

Some parasitoids can consume up to 100 pests like caterpillars, aphids, beetles, whiteflies or leafminers in their lifetime so they prevent pest populations getting to high.\n\nParasitoids are a natural and safer pesticide than chemical pesticides as they do not harm beneficial insects and animals, or contaminate the soil and water.",

For example, birds, bats, frogs and scorpions eat insects, and giant rats eat insects and small rodents.\n\nAs well as consuming pests, these animals also provide additional benefits like pollination, improving soil fertility by breaking down organic matter and creating a friendly eco-system by promoting biodiversity. Giant rats can also be a source of food for humans!",
