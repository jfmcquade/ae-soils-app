      "audio_transcript": "If you have a lot of grazing land, create temporary paddocks for the animals. Leave a large herd in the paddock for at least one week before moving them to another paddock. Thanks to the animals' pee and poop, the paddock area will be left enriched with nutrients ready to grow healthy crops.\nSimilarly with a boma, if you move the boma around then the animal manure will quickly rehabilitate the soil and improve your crop yields. This is better than having a boma full of manure that goes to waste as it is never used!",

      "audio_transcript": "Chickens can improve your soil in two ways. One, chicken manure is full of nutrients so why not spread this manure around your fields by using a chicken tractor? Two, chickens will scratch for bugs and weeds, and so they'll lightly till the soil and prepare it ready for growing crops.",

The manure feeds the aquatic plants that the fish feed on.\nThe easiest way to do this is to build your animal shed above the pond so that the animal poop can go straight down into the water, so you don't need to manually move it!",

      "audio_transcript": "Rather than spreading compost and farm residues thinly everywhere, it's more effective to concentrate the nutrients directly where the plants are getting them.\nYou can do this microdosing by digging Zai or Tumbukiza pits, big holes that are about one meter apart, and filling them with compost or a little fertilizer. Plant crops in these nutrient rich pits and see the results!\nYou can re-use the pits in the next planting season, but don't forget to add more organic fertiliser.",
