To ensure that you are getting all of the essential amino acids, you should also eat foods that are high in these amino acids, such as beans and other legumes. Additionally, animal-based proteins are generally considered to be of higher quality than plant-based proteins due to their higher digestibility. However, plant-based proteins can still provide all of the essential amino acids if consumed in sufficient quantities and in combination with other protein sources. \nHow well/ poorly a protein can perform its metabolic function in the body is defined by the protein quality in a substance. Some of the proteins with high quality are from animal sources like eggs, milk, meat, fish and poultry. Other examples like Soybean, groundnut, and buckweat are examples of protein rich foods.",
