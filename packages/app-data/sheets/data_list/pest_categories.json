      "audio_transcript": "Small, soft bodied insect pests cause damage especially to plant leaves; things like dark dots, bleached parts and strange leaf shapes. This is because the insects eat the cell contents of leaves with their piercing and sucking mouth parts. These small insects can also transfer viruses to plants as they move from an infected plant to a healthy plant.\n\nHave you noticed sticky leaves, or ants busy on infested plants? That's because when eating, aphids emit honeydew, a sticky substance, which is made up of the cell contents they can't digest. This honeydew is actually a source of food for insects like ants.\n\nAnts feed on the honeydew and even protect the aphids from their natural enemies in a way a farmer would protect his livestock.\n\nSoft-bodied pests can be easily controlled with botanical pesticides such as soap water and oil.",

      "audio_transcript": "Insects with chewing mouthparts, for example caterpillars and locusts, cause visible feeding damage. You may notice holes in leaves or other parts of the plant; leaf skeletonizing, which is when the tissue between the leaf veins is removed; or leaf loss when the leaves fall off.\nThese large insect pests can create very visible damage to plants: for example the plants might be leaning over or knocked down flat because the insects have eaten the plant roots, or cut through the stalks at the soil surface!",
