      "description": "These are all small, soft-bodied insects that feed by sucking plant sap. Damage may include: leaf dotting, leaf bleaching, leaf curling and deformation, sticky honeydew (whitish condensed sap) which may support the growth of sooty mold.",
      "examples": "Examples include: Aphids, Thrips, Spider mites, whiteflies.",
      "audio_transcript": "These pests have piercing and sucking mouth parts that ingest cell contents causing things like dots on the surface of the leaves. They also transfer viruses to plants as they move from an infected plant to a healthy plant. Contents that are not digested are emmited as secretions (honeydew) at the rear end of the insect and are a source of food for other insects such as ants.\n\nAnts tend to protect the aphids from their natural enemies in a way a farmer would protect his livestock. Soft-bodied pests can be easily controlled with botanical pesticides, soap water and oil.",

      "examples": "Examples include: Maize stalk borers, Cabbage worm, Fall army worm, Beet armyworm.",
      "audio_transcript": "Insects with chewing mouthparts, for example caterpillars and locusts cause feeding damage such as holes in leaves and other plant parts, leaf skeletonizing (removal of tissue between the leaf veins) or leaf loss. They sometimes cut through plants at the soil surface, or consume plant roots.",
