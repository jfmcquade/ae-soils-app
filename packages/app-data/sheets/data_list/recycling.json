The crops grown there tend to be healthy and vigorous.\nYou can make compost out of any plant debris or manure, and animal bedding is full of nutrient-rich urine so it makes excellent compost. Sunshine and rain make compost lose its nutritional value so cover it with a big plastic sheet, or build a shed for it to protect it.",

After the animals eat, you can use the remaining plant matter as their bedding and the plant remains will soak up the animal urine which is full of nutrients that can be used as manure.",

Biochar contains small particles that have electric charges which attract mineral nutrients that supports the growth of organic matter in the soil by acting as their habitat for years. Also, by burning biochar, you will end up with charcoal that is full of air space making your soil have a greater water-holding capacity.",
