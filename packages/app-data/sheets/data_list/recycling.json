      "description": "Organic farm waste can compost down and enrich your soil, turning it into loose dark healthy soil with channels that help it absorb water and make it easy to cultivate. Recycling plant debris and manure by making compost is really easy to do and creates healthy and vigorous crops as they have all the nutrients and minerals they need.",
      "illustration_1": "soil_health/soil_residue.PNG",
      "audio_transcript": "You can make compost out of any plant debris or manure. Ideally you want a good mixture of nitrogen rich green materials and carbon rich brown materials, like woody stems. Animal bedding is the best of both as it's full of nutrient-rich urine so it makes excellent compost.\nCut these waste products up into small pieces and heap them up into a protected corner, or in a shed, then leave them to rot down. A good compost heap is full of insects and micro-organisms. Sunshine and rain make compost lose its nutritional value so cover the pile with a big plastic sheet, or build a shed to protect it. Your compost is ready to use after about 6 months, when it's turned into dark brown crumbly soil and smells sweet.",

      "audio_transcript": "Some people opt to burn their farm’s remains after harvesting, however, you can store them and use them as animal fodder which is much wiser. After the animals eat, you can use the remaining plant matter as their bedding and the plant remains will soak up the animal urine. The bedding will be full of nutrients from the manure and tough stalks will have been broken up by the animals, so when you change the bedding be sure to put the old material into your compost heap.",

      "audio_transcript": "If your plant leaves start turning yellow, they might have a nitrogen deficiency.\nUrine is rich in nutrients, especially nitrogen, and is very easy to get hold of! Collect animal urine through their bedding, or human urine in a bucket in your toilet. Dilute it with water and pour onto the soil or your compost pile.",

      "description": "An alternative to compost, you can recycle ‘waste products’ from your farm by making biochar, a charcoal which helps soils absorb water and nutrients.",
      "illustration_1": "soil_health/Biochar.PNG",
      "audio_transcript": "Biochar is made by burning waste materials like sawdust, crop residue, or wood in a controlled way: at very high temperatures and without oxygen. This charcoal, or biochar, contains small particles with electric charges which attract minerals and nutrients that support the growth of soil microbes by acting as their habitat for years. Also, by adding biochar to your soil, it acts like compost and creates air spaces that help improve the soil's water and nutrient absorption.",

For example, rabbit farmers collect the urine from their animals, which can be used used as a fertiliser and as a pesticide.",
